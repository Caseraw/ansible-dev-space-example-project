# Step 5

Execute an interactive shell to the running container:

```shell
$ podman exec -it podman-ansible-dev-space-example bash

Agent pid 93
Identity added: /home/podman/.ssh/id_rsa (podman@8e3779663c4e)

[podman@8e3779663c4e project]$
```

> Log in and out anytime you would like as long as the container is running.
